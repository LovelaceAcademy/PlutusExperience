# Introduction

## Getting Started

In this module we'll see how to use custom types in our validation script, something critical to build useful smart contracts. We'll also create some tests for the validator using Plutip.

To run this presentation type (you will need [nix](https://nixos.org)):

```sh
../../slide README.md
```
